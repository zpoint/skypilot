=== Machine Learning Models ===

Training churn prediction model...
Features: age, income_bracket, satisfaction_score, complaints, support_calls, tenure_months
Target: churn_flag

Train/Test split: 80/20
Training samples: 36,689
Test samples: 9,172

Model performance:
- Random Forest Classifier
  * Accuracy: 89.4%
  * Precision: 0.847
  * Recall: 0.823
  * F1-Score: 0.834
  * AUC-ROC: 0.912

Feature importance:
1. satisfaction_score: 0.286
2. complaints: 0.234
3. tenure_months: 0.189
4. support_calls: 0.167
5. age: 0.078
6. income_bracket: 0.046

=== Recommendations ===

1. Customer Retention:
   - Focus on customers with satisfaction <3.0 (high churn risk)
   - Implement proactive support for customers with >2 complaints/month
   - Re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers (>30 days)

2. Revenue Optimization:
   - Target high-value customer segments (age 35-50, high income)
   - Promote credit card usage (higher transaction values)
   - Expand in entertainment and shopping categories

3. Operational Improvements:
   - Reduce support call volume through self-service options
   - Implement early warning system for churn prediction
   - Enhance customer satisfaction measurement
